## 3) [CSS Gallery](https://saadpocalypse.github.io/CSS-Playground/)
In this little project, I've had some fun exploring the creative side of web development by putting together a collection of HTML and CSS art. Over time, I've gotten proficient with CSS, which I use every now and then to make fun designs, whether its pixel art with tables or loading spinners. Everything on this website is made with pure HTML and CSS, no libraries, no images, no videos and minimal Javascript. I keep updating this website as I make more stuff.

## 4) [Color Picker](https://saadpocalypse.github.io/ColorPicker/)
This is a pretty simple game. You have to guess which box represents the given RGB value. When you hover over the button, the background changes to the color that you had to guess. If it's a bright color, the text turns black, otherwise it turns white. That's not hard to do, I just thought it was fun.
